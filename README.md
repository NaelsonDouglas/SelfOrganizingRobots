# SelfOrganizingRobots

It's a simulation of the self assembly robots from Havard University. 
The table is a matrix and the robots are just characters. The only purpose of this code is to reproduce the artificial inteligence(multi-agent systems, especially) part in a low budget way (I have no money for the robots. :) )
